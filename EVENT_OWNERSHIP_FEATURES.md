# Event Ownership and Management Features

## Overview
Successfully implemented event ownership, creator management, and participant tracking to prevent duplicate joins.

## Backend Changes

### 1. Updated Event Model (`server/models/Event.ts`)
Added new fields to track ownership and participants:
```typescript
- creatorId: mongoose.Types.ObjectId (ref: 'User', required)
- participants: mongoose.Types.ObjectId[] (ref: 'User', default: [])
```

### 2. Updated Event Endpoints

#### POST /api/events (Protected)
- Now automatically sets `creatorId` to the authenticated user
- Initializes empty `participants` array

#### GET /api/events & GET /api/events/:id
- Returns `creatorId` and `participants` array in response
- Transforms ObjectIds to strings for frontend consumption

#### PATCH /api/events/:id/join (Now Protected)
- Requires authentication
- **Prevents duplicate joins**: Checks if user is already in participants array
- Adds user to participants array
- Updates `currentParticipants` count automatically
- Returns error "You have already joined this event" if already joined

#### PATCH /api/events/:id/leave (Now Protected)
- Requires authentication
- Verifies user is actually a participant before allowing leave
- Removes user from participants array
- Updates `currentParticipants` count automatically
- Returns error "You are not a participant of this event" if not joined

#### PUT /api/events/:id (New - Protected)
**Creator-Only Endpoint**
- Allows event creator to update event details
- Validates creator ownership (403 error if not creator)
- Prevents reducing maxParticipants below current participants count
- Updates: title, description, location, date, maxParticipants, coordinates
- Returns error "You are not authorized to update this event" for non-creators

#### DELETE /api/events/:id (New - Protected)
**Creator-Only Endpoint**
- Allows event creator to delete their event
- Validates creator ownership (403 error if not creator)
- Removes event from database
- Returns error "You are not authorized to delete this event" for non-creators

### 3. Authorization Checks
- Creator verification: `event.creatorId.toString() === userId`
- Participant verification: `event.participants.some(p => p.toString() === userId)`
- Duplicate join prevention: Check before adding to participants array

## Frontend Changes

### 1. Updated Type Definitions (`src/types/database.types.ts`)
```typescript
export interface Event {
  // ... existing fields
  creatorId: string | null;
  participants: string[];
}
```

### 2. Updated Event Service (`src/services/eventService.ts`)
Added new methods:
- `updateEvent(id, data)`: PUT request to update event
- `deleteEvent(id)`: DELETE request to remove event
- Updated `joinEvent()` and `leaveEvent()` to include auth headers

### 3. Enhanced EventCard Component (`src/components/EventCard.tsx`)
**New Props:**
- `currentUserId?: string | null`

**Visual Indicators:**
- üü° **Creator Badge**: Shows "Creator" badge with crown icon for event owner
- üîµ **Joined Badge**: Shows "Joined" badge with checkmark for participants
- Badges appear next to event title

### 4. Enhanced EventModal Component (`src/components/EventModal.tsx`)
**New Props:**
- `currentUserId?: string | null`

**Delete Confirmation:**
- Shows confirmation dialog before deletion
- Message: "Are you sure you want to delete this event? This action cannot be undone."

### 5. New EditEventModal Component (`src/components/EditEventModal.tsx`)
**Features:**
- Pre-populated form with current event data
- All fields editable except currentParticipants
- Auto-geocoding for location changes (800ms debounce)
- Validation: maxParticipants cannot be less than currentParticipants
- Shows current participant count as information

- Location (with auto-geocoding)
- Date & Time (datetime-local input)
- Maximum Participants (min: current participants, max: 10000)
- Coordinates (auto-updated via geocoding)

### 6. Updated App Component (`src/App.tsx`)
**New State:**
- `editingEvent: Event | null` - Tracks event being edited

**New Handlers:**
- `handleUpdateEvent(eventId, data)`: Updates event and refreshes state
- `handleDeleteEvent(eventId)`: Deletes event and removes from list

**Component Updates:**
- Pass `currentUserId={user?.id}` to all EventCard components
- Pass `currentUserId={user?.id}` to EventModal
- Pass `onEdit` and `onDelete` handlers to EventModal
- Render EditEventModal when `editingEvent` is set

## User Experience Flow

### Creating an Event
1. User clicks "Create Event"
2. Fills out event form
3. Event is created with user as creator
4. "Creator" badge appears on their event cards

### Editing an Event (Creator Only)
1. Creator opens their event
2. Sees "Edit Event" and "Delete Event" buttons
3. Clicks "Edit Event"
4. EditEventModal opens with pre-filled data
5. Makes changes and clicks "Save Changes"
6. Event updates across all views

### Deleting an Event (Creator Only)
1. Creator opens their event
2. Clicks "Delete Event"
3. Confirmation dialog appears
4. Confirms deletion
5. Event removed from database and UI

### Joining an Event (First Time)
1. User opens an event they haven't joined
2. Sees "Join Event" button (enabled)

## Security Features

### Authorization
‚úÖ **Creator Verification**: Only event creator can edit/delete
‚úÖ **Authentication Required**: All join/leave/edit/delete operations require login
‚úÖ **Token Validation**: JWT token verified for all protected endpoints

### Data Integrity
‚úÖ **Duplicate Prevention**: Cannot join same event twice
‚úÖ **Participant Tracking**: Accurate count based on participants array
‚úÖ **Capacity Enforcement**: Cannot reduce max below current participants
‚úÖ **Ownership Validation**: Server-side creator checks prevent unauthorized modifications

### Error Handling
- ‚úÖ Clear error messages for unauthorized actions
- ‚úÖ Validation on both client and server
- ‚úÖ Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- ‚úÖ Loading states during operations

## Database Schema Updates

### Events Collection
```javascript
{
  // ... existing fields
  creatorId: ObjectId (ref: 'User', required)
  participants: [ObjectId] (ref: 'User', default: [])
  currentParticipants: Number (auto-updated from participants.length)
}
```

**Note**: Existing events in database won't have `creatorId` and will need migration or deletion.

## Testing Checklist

### Event Creation
- ‚úÖ Create event while logged in
- ‚úÖ Event has correct creatorId
- ‚úÖ Creator badge appears on event card
- ‚úÖ Creator sees edit/delete buttons

### Event Editing

- ‚úÖ Non-creator cannot edit (buttons hidden)
- ‚úÖ Changes reflect immediately
- ‚úÖ Cannot reduce max below current participants

### Event Deletion
- ‚úÖ Creator can delete their event
- ‚úÖ Confirmation dialog appears
- ‚úÖ Event removed from all views
- ‚úÖ Non-creator cannot delete

### Joining Events
- ‚úÖ User can join available events
- ‚úÖ "Joined" badge appears after joining
- ‚úÖ Cannot join same event twice (UI prevents)
- ‚úÖ Backend prevents duplicate joins with error
- ‚úÖ Participant count increases correctly

### Leaving Events
- ‚úÖ User can leave joined events
- ‚úÖ "Joined" badge disappears
- ‚úÖ Cannot leave event not joined
- ‚úÖ Participant count decreases correctly
- ‚úÖ Can rejoin after leaving

### Authorization
- ‚úÖ Only creator sees edit/delete options
- ‚úÖ API returns 403 for unauthorized edit/delete
- ‚úÖ Join/leave require authentication (401 without token)

## Known Considerations

### Database Migration
‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Existing events in the database don't have `creatorId` field. Options:
1. Delete all existing events and let users create new ones
2. Migrate existing events to a default user account
3. Mark old events with a special "system" creator

For development, clearing old events is recommended:
```javascript
// In MongoDB shell or Compass
db.events.deleteMany({})
```

### Participant Synchronization
- `currentParticipants` is automatically calculated from `participants.length`
- This ensures accuracy but means old manual counts are replaced
- Join/leave operations now update the participants array, not just the count

## Summary

The application now supports full event ownership and management:
- **Creators** can edit and delete their events
- **Participants** can join events only once
- **Everyone** can see who created events via badges
- **Security** enforced at both UI and API levels
- **User experience** clear with visual indicators and confirmation dialogs

All features are production-ready with proper error handling, validation, and user feedback! üéâ
